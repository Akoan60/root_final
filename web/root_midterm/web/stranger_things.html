				<h2>about the series</h2>
				<p>Stranger Things is a television-format series created by the Duffer Brothers. It was released as a Netflix original series premiering on July 15, 2016. The show takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the early-to-mid 1980s. The first season revolves around the disappearance of Will Byers, while the currently-in-production second season will explore the repercussions from the events of the first season.</p>

				<h2>summary</h2>
				<p>In a small town where everyone knows everyone, a peculiar incident starts a chain of events that leads to the disappearance of a child - which begins to tear at the fabric of an otherwise peaceful community. Dark government agencies and seemingly malevolent supernatural forces converge on the town while a few locals begin to understand that there's more going on than meets the eye.</p>
