				<h1>article 1</h1>
				<p>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.</p>

				<p>The Parsee's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design.  It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible.  They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly.</p>

				<p>"How large is Pellucidar?" I asked, wondering what sort of theory these primitive men had concerning the form and substance of their world.</p>

				<p>"The Mahars say it is round, like the inside of a tola shell," he answered, "but that is ridiculous, since, were it true, we should fall back were we to travel far in any direction, and all the waters of Pellucidar would run to one spot and drown us.  No, Pellucidar is quite flat and extends no man knows how far in all directions.  At the edges, so my ancestors have reported and handed down to me, is a great wall that prevents the earth and waters from escaping over into the burning sea whereon Pellucidar floats; but I never have been so far from Anoroc as to have seen this wall with my own eyes.  However, it is quite reasonable to believe that this is true, whereas there is no reason at all in the foolish belief of the Mahars.  According to them Pellucidarians who live upon the opposite side walk always with their heads pointed downward!" and Ja laughed uproariously at the very thought.</p>

				<p>It was plain to see that the human folk of this inner world had not advanced far in learning, and the thought that the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a very pathetic one indeed.  I wondered how many ages it would take to lift these people out of their ignorance even were it given to Perry and me to attempt it. <a href="#sec1">Back to the top!</a></p>

				Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the 	end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
				"No, noâ€”no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy, there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered. <a href="#sec2">See exemple 2 !</a>
